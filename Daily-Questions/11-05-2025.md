## Day 11-05-2025: Word Counter

### Difficulty: Easy

## Problem Statement

Given a sentence string, return the number of words that are in the sentence.

Words are any sequence of non-space characters and are separated by a single space.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: "Hello world"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The sentence contains two words: "Hello" and "world"
```

### Example 2
```
Input: "The quick brown fox"
Output: 4
Explanation:
The sentence contains four words: "The", "quick", "brown", and "fox"
```

### Example 3
```
Input: "I"
Output: 1
Explanation:
The sentence contains only one word: "I"
```

### Example 4
```
Input: "Programming is fun"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The sentence contains three words: "Programming", "is", and "fun"
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= sentence.length <= 10^4
- sentence consists of printable ASCII characters.
- Words are separated by a single space character.
- The sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.
- There are no consecutive spaces in the sentence.

## Follow-up

Can you solve this problem without using built-in string methods like split()? How would you handle sentences with multiple consecutive spaces or leading/trailing spaces?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Think about how words are separated. What character marks the boundary between words?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
You can count the number of spaces and derive the word count from that. How many words would there be relative to the number of spaces?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
If you iterate through the sentence character by character, you can count transitions from space to non-space characters.
</details>

## Suggested Approach (short contract)

- Input: a string `sentence`.
- Output: an integer representing the number of words in the sentence.
- Error modes: if `sentence` is empty, return 0.
- Success: produce the correct word count.

Edge cases:
- Empty string.
- Single word sentence.
- Sentence with many words.

## Time & Space Complexity

- Time: O(n) — where n is the length of the sentence (single pass through the string).
- Space: O(1) — constant extra space if counting manually, O(n) if using split() method.

## Example Implementation Ideas

### Approach 1: Using built-in split() method
- Split the sentence by spaces
- Count the number of resulting words
- Return the count

### Approach 2: Counting spaces
- Count the number of spaces in the sentence
- Word count = number of spaces + 1
- Return the count

### Approach 3: Manual iteration
- Iterate through the sentence character by character
- Count transitions from space to non-space (beginning of a new word)
- Keep track of whether we're currently in a word or not
- Return the word count

## Code Templates

### JavaScript
```javascript
function countWords(sentence) {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Python
```python
def count_words(sentence):
    # Your code here
    pass
```

### Java
```java
public class Solution {
    public int countWords(String sentence) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countWords(string sentence) {
        // Your code here
    }
};
```
